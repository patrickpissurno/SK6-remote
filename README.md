# SK6 Remote
Make your LG SK6 soundbar remote controller work with your computer

## Disclaimer
This program requires an Arduino-compatible device to be plugged into the computer for it to work.

We provide a [custom Sketch](https://github.com/patrickpissurno/SK6-remote/blob/master/receiver/receiver.ino) for you to flash the Arduino with.

**Please note that you will also need an IR receiver properly connected to the Arduino board.**
